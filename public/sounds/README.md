# Sound Files

Place the following sound files in this directory for the 3D dice animations:

- `dice-roll.mp3` - Sound when dice start rolling
- `dice-land.mp3` - Sound when dice finish rolling
- `dice-critical.mp3` - Special sound for critical rolls (3 or 18 on 3d6)

The sounds are optional. The app will work without them, just without audio feedback.
